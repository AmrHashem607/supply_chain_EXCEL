## 🎯 Business Problem & Objective
### Business Problem
Supply chain and logistics teams often lack a unified view of how orders, deliveries, and inventory perform across regions and customer segments. Without a consolidated dashboard, tracking KPIs like on‑time delivery or units shipped can be inefficient and error‑prone.

### Project Objective
- Build an **Excel‑based dashboard** that showcases critical supply chain KPIs  
- Provide interactive visual insights with filters and charts  
- Highlight trends and performance gaps for operational decision‑making

## 🧠 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Microsoft Excel**  
- Pivot Tables & Charts  
- Slicers for interactive filtering  
- Conditional Formatting for Trends & Highlights  
- Data Cleaning & Structuring

## 📂 Dataset & Key Metrics
The dashboard uses the dataset file **supply_chain_data (Assignment).xlsx** which includes information like:

- Order ID  
- Customer  
- Product  
- Region  
- Order Quantity  
- Shipping Date  
- Delivery Performance Metrics  
- Revenue & Cost

These fields are used to calculate important KPIs such as delivery performance and revenue trends.

## 📈 Key KPIs & Insights
### 📊 Main KPIs
- **Total Orders** – Count of orders in dataset  
- **Total Revenue** – Sum of sales across all customers  
- **On‑Time Delivery %** – Percentage of timely deliveries
